# Yield-Voyager-assignment-1

For this assignment I created a small web-based social prototype that uses MetaMask as the login system. Instead of asking users to create a normal username and password, the website connects directly to their Ethereum wallet, and the wallet address becomes their identity. The entire project runs on the frontend, and all user data is saved temporarily in the browser (using localStorage), since the goal was to demonstrate the concept and not build a full backend.

I redesigned the user interface from scratch to give it a premium, Apple-inspired look. I specifically used a neutral grey color palette with a subtle teal accent, because it creates a clean and modern feel without being too flashy. Apple’s design language focuses on soft edges, smooth gradients, gentle contrast, and large spacing — so I applied those ideas in the layout, cards, panels, and buttons.
